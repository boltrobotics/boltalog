# Introduction

Project's goals:

* Define a model of application's log events
* Generate C++ wrapper code
* Use the code on AVR / STM32 / x86
* Share the model with system operators
* Share the model with technical writers
* Reduce typing of similiar code through the use of templates
* Reduce bugs through pre-defined code templates
